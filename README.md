This project is part of my journey to learn and explore Spring Boot, a powerful framework for building Java-based backend services.
The Ekart backend serves as a practical implementation where I am experimenting with various Spring Boot features, such as RESTful APIs, database interaction with Spring Data JPA,
and application configuration. Through this project, I aim to deepen my understanding of Spring Boot and its ecosystem.
